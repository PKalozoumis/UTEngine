# UTEngine

STATUS: ABANDONED

A small game engine made for fun in C++ using SDL2, specifically designed for UNDERTALE fan-games.

Features:
* You can move around. Most keys are detectable and you can even change the keys for each function.
* Music and sounds.
* Saving and loading (currently only saves your position).
* You can take in-game screenshots!
* Fullscreen mode.
* Debug menu (you can even use the mouse to click on buttons!)
* Suport for multiple rooms, of varying sizes. Camera inside the rooms also works flawlessly!
* SUPER OPTIMIZED ROOMS??? Tiles that aren't within a distance from the player don't get drawn at all.
* Compatibility with Tiled. Make tiles, tilesets and entire rooms, export them as JSON and import them straight into the game. Works like MAGIC! (probably my favorite feature tbh)
* Text! You can color text, resize text, change typing speed, give text outlines (many different options), color those outlines, make text shake and most importantly: text splits automatically into multiple (up to INFINITE?? ~don't try this it's not yet optimized~) lines!! BONUS FEATURE: Text somehow disappears when you enter fullscreen ~(how do i fix this help)~
